Here is my dumb little help file
================================

But it really isn't very helpful.

It is, in fact, almost entirely, and really quite inexplicably,
even, perhaps, unforgivably, a complete waste of the reader's time.

It reminds me of this one time I was fishing in the Adirondacks.
Unknown to me at the time, I was in a territory frequented by bears,
and I'd brought along a big bag of pop-tarts to snack on. It turns
out bears LOVE pop-tarts. But, I digress.

See? Complete waste of time.

Although there is this funny thing about bears. If you come across
bear poop, you should examine it. Brown bears survive on nuts and
berries, and this is easily visible in their stool. If you're in
brown bear country, you should equip yourself with a whistle and a
can of pepper spray in order to chase off any bears that approach.

Now if you're in grizzly bear country it is a different matter.
The way you can tell is that the bear stool shows evidence of
whistles and cans of pepper spray.
