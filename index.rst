Will this be the root document for this silly thing? Because if it were, that
would be lovely. I've been scratching my head trying to figure out how to make
that happen.

A lot of global documentation ended up in ``foo/__init__.py``, so click on the link
for the ``foo`` module to see it.

The version of RST used in epydoc's docstrings is `different`_ from the
version used in `this file`_, because this file is built to HTML using
rst2html.

BTW, the source code for this is `on Github`_.

.. _different: http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/epydoc.html#the-epytext-markup-language
.. _`this file`: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html
.. _`on Github`: https://github.com/wware/dumb-epydoc-project
